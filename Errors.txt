Priorities:
- Game Over screen - Mostly done (just get the title to go up)
    - Display information
    - Have exit button
    - Display if they won or not
- Format and clean up code and writing the stuff in README
- Continue game is janky
    - Requires user to hit "Alt" key before starting for some reason
        - setFocusable for panel (this)
    - QTE not showing up properly
    - Not comparing the direction faced and monster attack direction correctly
        - Therefore QTE is not showing up

Optional Features:
- Make the buttons look nice
- Make things look cleaner
- Somehow make it so that after the second to last direction, it says "and"
- Show a message saying that the user will be overwriting an existing save file if they start new game
- Make a "demo" difficulty where it is just one floor
